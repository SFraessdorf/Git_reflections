When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- to store the work on a safe
- to ensure to work with other colleagues or people or contributors

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I want to decide when it is the best point of time to sync

How to sync with remote repository

- to sync local changes to remote repo use: git push <remote repository, normally origin> <branch-name>
- checkout branch what has to be synced
- to get remote changes to local repo use: git pull <remote repository, normally origin> <branch-name>
