What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
to init a git repo: git init
- no commits are created
- repo is prepared but nothin will be tracked
- each file that should be tracked has to be added by: git add <file>

to config name for commits set: git config --global user.name "Sebastian Fräßdorf"
to config email for commits set: git config --global user.email "sebastian.fraessdorf@gmail.com"

to commit changes to all files use: git commit -a
- configured editor will open to add commit message
- after closing editor commit will be done

to remove a file from the stage area use: git reset <file>
- file will not deleted only unstaged

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- the working directory contains all files in certain state
- in the working directory you checkout the files of a commit you want
- the staging area is a kind of virtual environment to stage changes of files
