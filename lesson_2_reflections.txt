What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
to init a git repo: git init
- no commits are created
- repo is prepared but nothin will be tracked
- each file that should be tracked has to be added by: git add <file>

to config name for commits set: git config --global user.name "Sebastian Fräßdorf"
to config email for commits set: git config --global user.email "sebastian.fraessdorf@gmail.com"

to commit changes to all files use: git commit -a
- configured editor will open to add commit message
- after closing editor commit will be done

to remove a file from the stage area use: git reset <file>
- file will not deleted only unstaged

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- the working directory contains all files in certain state
- in the working directory you checkout the files of a commit you want
- the staging area is a kind of virtual environment to stage changes of files

Different versions of git diff
git diff
- diff between working directory and staging area

git diff --staged
- diff between staging area and most recent commit

git diff commit1 commit2
- diff between commit1 and commit2, commit2 is the commit to analyze

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- use git diff --staged to check what would be content of a commit
- use git reset <file> to revert staged file

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- branches are helpful for developing new features or different versions of a tool in parallel

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- in the diagrams you can see what commits are reachable by what branch
- create always a new branch before starting on a new context like a bugfix, new feature or what ever
- use: git log --graph --oneline master <branchX> <branchY>
 - displays branch diagram and the relationships of the commits
 
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
- by merging both branches will be combined, each commit is ordered by timestamp
- after a merge of a branch, the branch can be investigated in the master branch
- create a branch before make changes
- normally checkout master branch and than call: git merge <branch-name-to-merge>
- after a successful merge the merge branch can be deleted with: git branch -d <branch-name>
- if a merge does not work you get a merge conflict
- do revert/cancel a merge use: git merge --abort
- to compare a commit with its parent use: git show <commitID>
- after a merge not each ordered commit is a parent of its predeseccor
